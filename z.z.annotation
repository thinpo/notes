/*
 * z.z.annotation - Extended Benchmark and Validation Suite
 *
 * This file represents an extended benchmark suite that complements the main
 * test file (z), providing additional validation scenarios, stress tests, and
 * performance regression checks. It demonstrates the sophisticated testing
 * methodology required for high-performance array programming languages.
 *
 * The existence of multiple test files reflects the reality that different
 * benchmarking scenarios are needed for comprehensive performance validation:
 * - Main tests for standard performance measurement
 * - Extended tests for edge cases and stress testing
 * - Regression tests for development workflow
 * - Validation tests for correctness verification
 *
 * DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
 * - Comprehensive coverage of all computational kernels
 * - Stress testing beyond normal operating parameters
 * - Regression detection for performance-critical paths
 * - Validation of mathematical correctness under extreme conditions
 * - Cross-platform performance comparison baselines

/*
 * OVERALL EXTENDED BENCHMARK DESIGN ASSESSMENT:
 *
 * This extended benchmark suite demonstrates several sophisticated
 * testing methodologies:
 *
 * 1. REGRESSION TESTING:
 *    Repeated tests from the main suite ensure performance
 *    characteristics remain stable across development cycles.
 *    Critical for maintaining performance in production systems.
 *
 * 2. SCALE VALIDATION:
 *    Larger problem sizes (960 vs 64 elements) test algorithm
 *    scaling behavior and cache hierarchy utilization beyond
 *    toy examples to realistic computational workloads.
 *
 * 3. MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY:
 *    Different iteration counts (10 vs 100, 1e2 vs 100) enable
 *    analysis of measurement variance and statistical significance.
 *    Important for distinguishing real performance differences
 *    from measurement noise.
 *
 * 4. ALGORITHMIC VALIDATION:
 *    Testing the same operations at different scales validates
 *    that algorithms maintain efficiency and correctness across
 *    the full range of expected problem sizes.
 *
 * 5. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
 *    Extended tests with larger datasets ensure mathematical
 *    operations maintain accuracy and don't suffer from
 *    accumulated errors or numerical instability.
 *
 * 6. CROSS-PLATFORM CONSISTENCY:
 *    Identical hardware specifications enable validation that
 *    the same code produces consistent results across different
 *    test environments and development setups.
 *
 * 7. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:
 *    Having multiple test suites enables different testing
 *    strategies - quick smoke tests vs comprehensive validation
 *    vs performance regression detection.
 *
 * The existence of this extended test suite reflects the
 * professional-grade approach required for high-performance
 * computing systems where performance predictability and
 * correctness are equally critical.
 *
 * This level of testing sophistication is what separates
 * research prototypes from production-ready systems capable
 * of supporting serious computational workloads where both
 * performance and reliability matter.
